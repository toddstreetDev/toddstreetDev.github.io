        Every day, I’m awed and inspired by the individual and collective talents of our team.

        Their passion, commitment and value that they bring to our business, and in turn our clients, demands nothing but my deepest respect.

        From inception, I wanted toddstreet to be a company that delivered significant contributions in support of our clients businesses, while remaining cognizant of our teams’ personal interests, especially their philanthropic activities.

        Our unified commitment to apply our talents and capacities to benefit charitable organizations for social good broadens our experience, insight, creativity and awareness with the work we do for our clients. We believe we’re all better for it.
