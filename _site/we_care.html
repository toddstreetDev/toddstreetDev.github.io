                      <p>A toddstreet team member welcomes spring by volunteering at a city park.</p>
                      <p>When Caitlin Halle, one of our Project Managers, told us she wanted to take a day off to go to the park, she didn’t mean she wanted to catch up on her tan. This April, Caitlin volunteered at <a href="http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/support-the-park" target="_blank">Friends of Hudson River Park</a> an independent, nonprofit organization dedicated to the completion, care, and enhancement of Hudson River Park.</p>
                      <p>Caitlin, an Illinois native, relocated to New York five years ago, and immediately sought out the city’s green spaces for recreation and to remain connected with nature. Hudson River Park, with its wide boardwalks and pristine lawns became a personal favorite, and she hopes everyone can benefit from city parks like it.</p>
                      <p>“It’s important, especially in such a big city, to have spaces for children to get to enjoy sports and where families can form a community, says Caitlin, “The parks and piers along the Hudson allow families from all over to come enjoy summertime activities, sports, and camps that they might not otherwise have access to.”</p>
                      <p>Caitlin helped greet guests at the organization’s first-annual event, which was hosted by a committee of celebrities including Martha Stewart, Brooke Shields, and Nate Berkus. The organization treated donors to a performance by singer Janelle Monae and haut cuisine from the French eatery Le District, raising nearly $500,000 in the process.</p>
                      <p>We couldn’t agree more with Caitlin and Friends of Hudson River Park about the importance of taking care of our green spaces. It wouldn’t quite be spring in the city without them.</p>

                        <p>In June, our video coordinator Kate Moran participated in a month-long internship through SWS (Social Welfare Society, Inc.) in South Korea, volunteering with one of their affiliated orphanages, the Ehwa Infant Reception Center, in Naju, a small town in the South Jeolla Province of South Korea. The orphanage provides a loving home for nearly 50 young children, ranging from infancy to 5 years of age. Kate assisted in childcare responsibilities, including accompanying children on trips to the medical office.</p>
                        <p>My time at Ehwa was wonderful and incredibly illuminating. The children are happy, loving, and healthy, as well as extremely adorable – but what impressed me most was the tirelessly hard-working staff and caretakers who have dedicated their life into improving the lives of these young children. These children do need homes, and I hope each one of them is adopted by a loving family as quickly as possible – but they are most definitely loved.</p>
                        <p>More information on SWS can be found <a href="http://www.sws.or.kr/sub_main_en/main/main.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                          <p>When the managing editor of Babble.com, a Disney Interactive parenting website, reached out to us about supporting a pro-bono initiative for Mother’s Day, we jumped on the opportunity. Babble’s Motherhood in Focus campaign honors hard-working, single moms from low-income NYC communities who are rarely in photos with their kids; instead, they are always the ones taking the photos.</p>
                          <p>Professional photographer, Ahna Tessler, and Babble decided to change that. Ahna spent hours with the families, capturing special moments of these moms and their children. The photos would be made into albums and canvases and unveiled to the moms at the April 30th event. So Sara Goldberg, one of our producers, gathered a team together and we got to work!</p>
                          <p>After meeting with the Babble team and hearing their vision, we began the search for the perfect venue – a space that could drive focus to the 25 photo canvases. The Helen Mills event hall fit all the requirements!</p>
                          <p>We volunteered our time over the last 2 months designing floor plans, developing a run of show, securing catering that included donations from local bakeries, managing lighting and production logistics and overseeing the branding and deliverables which came to life with printing donated by our incredible print partner, Refined Sight. IMG_3044We brainstormed with Babble on a daily basis, bouncing ideas off of each other and partnering in the creative development of the event.</p>
                          <p>toddstreet photographer, Eli Tawil, graciously donated his time, and talent, to shoot the event, capturing the extraordinary moms in the moments when the images of their families were revealed for the first time.</p>
                          <p>A HUGE thank you to Audra Jones, Meaghan Pratt, Eli Tawil, Kate Moran and Chelsea Parry for their incredible efforts on making this event a huge success! We are proud to support Babble, Motherhood in Focus, and the wonderful families they represent.</p>
