toddstreet joins forces with an outstanding government organization to promote a healthier future.

Founded in 2010, the Partnership for a Healthier America is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization led by honorary Chairperson First Lady Michelle Obama, and some of the nation’s most respected health and childhood obesity advocates. Their annual “Building a Healthier Future” Summit serves as an opportunity for those in the private sector to address issues critical to our country’s health and well being.
Michelle Obama, who appeared live at the summit, encouraged attendees to “celebrate, challenge, champion” the fight against childhood obesity.

toddstreet produced six pro-bono videos for this year’s five-year anniversary summit, which included working directly with the White House on the First Lady’s “Let’s Move Campaign.” While Ronnie Litwack, our Director of Video Production, curated the content--supported by Video Coordinator, Eli Tawil--working with the PHA continues to be an enlightening and inspiring experience for all of us at toddstreet.

“The goals of this initiative are challenging, but, the PHA is making incredible impact,” says Ronnie, who along with several other team members witnessed firsthand the dedication of the PHA staff.

When Obama launched the “Gimme Five” Challenge, she asked Americans to use social media to share five healthy choices they’re making. Part of our five? A 5K Color Run that a number of team members will participate in this May.
