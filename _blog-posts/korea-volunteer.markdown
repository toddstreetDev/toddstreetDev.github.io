In June, our video coordinator Kate Moran participated in a month-long internship through SWS (Social Welfare Society, Inc.) in South Korea, volunteering with one of their affiliated orphanages, the Ehwa Infant Reception Center, in Naju, a small town in the South Jeolla Province of South Korea. The orphanage provides a loving home for nearly 50 young children, ranging from infancy to 5 years of age. Kate assisted in childcare responsibilities, including accompanying children on trips to the medical office.

My time at Ehwa was wonderful and incredibly illuminating. The children are happy, loving, and healthy, as well as extremely adorable – but what impressed me most was the tirelessly hard-working staff and caretakers who have dedicated their life into improving the lives of these young children. These children do need homes, and I hope each one of them is adopted by a loving family as quickly as possible – but they are most definitely loved.
