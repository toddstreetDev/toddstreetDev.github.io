Recently, we were asked if we could donate our services to produce a video for a fundraising Gala for SAVE, A Friend to Homeless Animals Shelter.

Given that animal rescue has a special place in our hearts with multiple staff having adopted their beloved pets from shelters, we were more than happy to assist.

We managed to produce the shoot in between many video projects, several snow storms, and scheduling a small crew to be available to go out and shoot several times. (never work with animals or children, right!?)

Craig, our Video Producer, saved the day and was able to get the shoot finalized before SAVE's major fundraising Gala.
