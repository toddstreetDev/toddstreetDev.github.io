A toddstreet team member welcomes spring by volunteering at a city park.

When Caitlin Halle, one of our Project Managers, told us she wanted to take a day off to go to the park, she didn’t mean she wanted to catch up on her tan. This April, Caitlin volunteered at [Friends of Hudson River Park](http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/support-the-park){:target="_blank"} an independent, nonprofit organization dedicated to the completion, care, and enhancement of Hudson River Park.

Caitlin, an Illinois native, relocated to New York five years ago, and immediately sought out the city’s green spaces for recreation and to remain connected with nature. Hudson River Park, with its wide boardwalks and pristine lawns became a personal favorite, and she hopes everyone can benefit from city parks like it.

“It’s important, especially in such a big city, to have spaces for children to get to enjoy sports and where families can form a community, says Caitlin, “The parks and piers along the Hudson allow families from all over to come enjoy summertime activities, sports, and camps that they might not otherwise have access to.”

Caitlin helped greet guests at the organization’s first-annual event, which was hosted by a committee of celebrities including Martha Stewart, Brooke Shields, and Nate Berkus. The organization treated donors to a performance by singer Janelle Monae and haut cuisine from the French eatery Le District, raising nearly $500,000 in the process.

We couldn’t agree more with Caitlin and Friends of Hudson River Park about the importance of taking care of our green spaces. It wouldn’t quite be spring in the city without them.
