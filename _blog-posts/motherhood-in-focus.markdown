When the managing editor of Babble.com, a Disney Interactive parenting website, reached out to us about supporting a pro-bono initiative for Mother’s Day, we jumped on the opportunity. Babble’s Motherhood in Focus campaign honors hard-working, single moms from low-income NYC communities who are rarely in photos with their kids; instead, they are always the ones taking the photos.

Professional photographer, Ahna Tessler, and Babble decided to change that. Ahna spent hours with the families, capturing special moments of these moms and their children. The photos would be made into albums and canvases and unveiled to the moms at the April 30th event. So Sara Goldberg, one of our producers, gathered a team together and we got to work!

After meeting with the Babble team and hearing their vision, we began the search for the perfect venue – a space that could drive focus to the 25 photo canvases. The Helen Mills event hall fit all the requirements!

We volunteered our time over the last 2 months designing floor plans, developing a run of show, securing catering that included donations from local bakeries, managing lighting and production logistics and overseeing the branding and deliverables which came to life with printing donated by our incredible print partner, Refined Sight. IMG_3044We brainstormed with Babble on a daily basis, bouncing ideas off of each other and partnering in the creative development of the event.

toddstreet photographer, Eli Tawil, graciously donated his time, and talent, to shoot the event, capturing the extraordinary moms in the moments when the images of their families were revealed for the first time.

A HUGE thank you to Audra Jones, Meaghan Pratt, Eli Tawil, Kate Moran and Chelsea Parry for their incredible efforts on making this event a huge success! We are proud to support Babble, Motherhood in Focus, and the wonderful families they represent.
