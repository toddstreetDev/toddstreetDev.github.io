More than 62 thousand people will be on the streets of NYC this winter, with 24 thousand of them being children. With the holidays coming, and really reflecting on the year behind us, we wanted a way to share with those less fortunate than ourselves. So we decided to collect basic items like soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, coats, gloves, socks, etc. and send them to the Bowery Resident’s Committee to be put to good use.

The Bowery Residents’ Committee, a transitional service that specializes in assisting the homeless, is one of the largest and oldest organizations in New York City. For 45 years, they have successfully moved people from the streets into permanent housing, serving more than 11 thousand people through their programs just last year alone. Hearing this, we realized how much the BRC is able to accomplish but also how much demand these services are in; right here in our own city.

Such basic items for us are monumental for those who do not have access to them. This communal effort really humbled us and allowed everyone an opportunity to give back on behalf of #tsCARES.
